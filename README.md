This project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning. The Breast Cancer Dataset was used, and the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Different algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost were tested to find the most accurate model. Visualizations like pair plots and heatmaps were used to better understand the data and its patterns. After scaling and splitting the dataset, XGBoost delivered the best results with an accuracy of 98.24%. The trained model was then saved using pickle, making it ready for real-world use.
